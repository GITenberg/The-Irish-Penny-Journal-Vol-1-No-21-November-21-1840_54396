<h2>THE SOUND AND ISLAND OF DALKEY, COUNTY OF DUBLIN.</h2>

<p>The little rocky island of Dalkey forms the south-eastern
extremity of the Bay of Dublin, as the bold and nearly insulated
promontory of Howth forms its north-eastern termination.
It is separated from the mainland of the parish from
which it takes, or to which, perhaps, it gives its name, by a
channel called Dalkey Sound, which is about nine hundred
yards long, three hundred and eight yards wide at its south
entrance, and two hundred and nine yards wide at its north
entrance; the soundings in mid-channel varying from ten to
five fathoms. This channel was anciently considered a tolerably
safe and convenient harbour, and was the principal anchorage
for ships frequenting the little castellated seaport town
of Dalkey, from which merchandise was transferred to Dublin,
as well by boats as by cars. Hence also the harbour of Dalkey
was frequently used in former times on state occasions for
the embarkation or landing of the Irish viceroys and other
state officers. The Lord Deputy Philip de Courtney landed
here in 1386, and Sir John Stanley, the deputy of the Marquis
of Dublin, in the following year. In 1414, Sir John Talbot,
then Lord Furnival, and afterwards the renowned Earl of
Shrewsbury, landed here as Viceroy of Ireland; and in 1488,
Sir Richard Edgecombe embarked at this harbour for England,
after having taken the homage and oaths of fidelity of
the nobility who had espoused the cause of Lambert Simnel.
Here also landed Sir Edward Bellingham, Lord-Lieutenant in
1548, and Sir Anthony St Leger in 1553; and it was from
this harbour that the Earl of Sussex, in 1558, embarked a
large body of forces to oppose the Scottish invaders at the isle
of Rathlin; and lastly, again, it was here that the unfortunate
Sir John Perrot landed as viceroy in 1584. The conversion
of this sound into an asylum harbour was at one time contemplated
by government, and a plan for the purpose was proposed
by the Committee of Inland Navigation; but from certain
objections which were made to it, the project was abandoned.
The situation would certainly have been a more imposing and
magnificent one than that ultimately chosen.</p>

<p>The island of Dalkey is of a nearly oval form, having a
very irregular surface, in part rocky, and in part consisting
of a fertile salt marsh, very valuable for the cure of sick cattle,
who by feeding on it quickly recover and fatten. It is
five hundred and twenty-eight yards long from north to
south, and three hundred and eight yards wide from east to
west, and comprises about twenty-nine acres of pasture. Its
shore is rocky, and in some parts precipitous, and it commands
the most beautiful views of the bays of Dublin and Killiney.
Among several springs of fresh water on it, one on its south-west
side has long been considered to possess sanative properties,
and was formerly much resorted to for the cure of
scurvy and other diseases. On the same side there are the
roofless walls of an ancient church dedicated to St Benet or
Benedict, the patron of the parish; and at its south-eastern
extremity there is a battery, and a Martello tower which differs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
from all the other structures of this class erected on the
Irish coast, in having its entrance not at the side but on its
top. It is traditionally stated that during the remarkable
plague which visited Dublin in 1575, many of the citizens fled
to this island for safety.</p>

<p>Dalkey island has several smaller ones contiguous to it, one
of which, denominated Lamb Island, is covered with grass,
while the others present a surface of bare granite. Of the
latter islets one is called Clare Rock, and another the Maiden
Rock, an appellation derived from a tradition said to be of
twelve hundred years’ antiquity, that twelve young maidens
from Bullock and Dalkey having gone over to this rock to
gather <i lang="ga">duilisk</i>, they were overtaken by a sudden storm so
violent as to prohibit assistance from the larger island, and all
miserably perished. To the north of these islands is situated
the group of rocks called the Muglins, extending one
hundred and thirty-two yards in length, and seventy-one in
width. On those rocks, in 1765, the pirates Mac Kinley and
Gidley were hanged in chains for the murder of Captain Glass.</p>

<p>Most of the features we have thus noticed, together with a
portion of the adjacent shore of the bay, are exhibited in our
prefixed illustration; and to the older citizens of our metropolis,
as well as to many others of our countrymen, they must,
we think, awaken many stirring recollections of the striking
changes in the appearance of the scenery in many districts
adjacent to the city, as well as in the character of the citizens
themselves, which have taken place within the present century.
It does not, indeed, require a very great age for any
of us Dublinians to remember when the country along the
southern shore of our beautiful bay, from Dunleary to the
land’s-end on Dalkey common, presented a nearly uniform
character of wildness and solitude&mdash;heathy grounds, broken
only by masses of granite rocks, and tufts of blossomy
furse, without culture, and, except in the little walled villages
of Bullock and Dalkey, almost uninhabited. The district
known as the Commons of Dalkey, which extended from the
village to the eastern extremity of the bay, “the Sound,” or
channel lying on its north-east, and the rocky hill of Dalkey
on its south&mdash;this in particular was a locality of singularly
romantic beauty, a creation of nature in her most sportive
mood, and wholly untouched, as it would appear, by the hand
of man. Giant masses of granite rocks, sometimes forming
detached groups, and at others arranged into semicircular
and even circular ledges, gave the greatest variety and
inequalities of surface, and formed numerous dells of the
greenest sward, so singularly wild and secluded that the elves
themselves might justly claim them as their own. To these
natural features should be added those of the rocky iron-bound
coast, with its little coves, commanding from its cliffs
the most delightful views of Killiney Bay, the Sound, the
Island of Dalkey, and the Bay of Dublin. These latter features
still remain, and can never change; but of all the others
which we have noticed, what is there left? Scarcely a vestige
that would remind the spectator of what the locality had
been. The rocks have been nearly all removed, or converted
into building materials for an assemblage of houses of all kinds
of fantastic construction, surrounded for the most part by
high and unsightly stone walls; and, except in the views obtained
from some spots in it, the picturesque beauty of Dalkey
common is gone for ever.</p>

<p>The common of Dalkey is now a place of life&mdash;a suburb, as
we might say, of the city; but at the period to which we have
alluded, it was ordinarily a scene of the most desert solitude.
A few cottages stretching from the village along its
southern boundary, and a solitary cabin originally built by
miners, and which still remains, were the only habitations to
be seen. But though thus uninhabited, it was not at all times
a scene of loneliness. On Sundays and other holidays its rocks
and dells were peopled with numerous pic-nic or sod parties
of the middle class of the citizens. The song went round,
and the echoes were startled by the merry notes of the fiddle
or the flute, to which the several groups of happy dancers
footed the Irish jig and country dance. Nor were such pic-nics
confined exclusively to the citizens of the middle class&mdash;the
sporters of jaunting cars and jingles. Parties of the
higher ranks occasionally assembled here on week days, and
had their rural fetes on a larger and more magnificent scale.
It was our own good fortune to be an invited guest to one of
these, of which we may be permitted to give some account, as
an example of a state of manners and usages of society in Ireland
now no longer to be found in persons of the class to
which we refer. It was a pic-nic party given by the Alexanders,
the Armits, and the present popular and deservedly honoured
veteran the Commander of the Forces in Ireland&mdash;then
lieutenant-colonel of the 18th or Royal Irish Fusileers,
which were at the time quartered in Dublin. On the morning
of as beautiful a day in June as ever came, the inhabitants of
the leading thoroughfares of the city, and those along the road
side from Dublin to Dunleary, were surprised by the unusual
crowds of open carriages of all kinds conveying the youth and
beauty of the aristocracy of the metropolis to the chosen
scene; and when the fine band of the Fusileers, in their magnificent
full-dress uniforms of blue and gold, were seen to pass
along on the same route, innumerable parties of the inferior
ranks of the inhabitants of the city and south-eastern suburbs
were hastily formed to follow in their wake. At noon, or a
little after, not only the majority of the original party were
assembled in a beautiful and extensive green amphitheatre,
surrounded by rocky cliffs, but those cliffs were themselves
covered by a crowd of smaller parties&mdash;tributary stars around
the more splendid galaxy that occupied the centre of the brilliant
scene.</p>

<p>Two splendid marquees were erected at an early hour in
the morning&mdash;one for the accommodation of the ladies, the
other for the dinner party; and two beautiful pleasure-yachts
which conveyed a portion of the invited to the scene, rested
at anchor in the Sound, and with their white sails and coloured
streamers contributed their share of life and beauty to the
landscape. Let the reader then imagine what a spectacle was
presented when the groups of quadrille-dancers&mdash;the beauty
and gallantry of the metropolis and its vicinity&mdash;commenced
dancing on the greensward to the music of one of the finest of
military bands&mdash;what a delight to the happy multitude of spectators
who looked on at the graceful and tempered gaiety of
high life! The mind of the accomplished painter Watteau, in
his finest pictures of the <i lang="fr">fetes champetres</i> of the French, never
conceived any thing so exquisitely beautiful and romantic.</p>

<p>This party did not disperse till after sunset. After an early
dinner, dancing was again resumed; and it is worthy of remark
that throughout the day there was not a single instance of
rudeness or indecorum on the part of the uninvited spectators&mdash;no
attempt even to approach beyond the natural rocky
boundary which they had chosen for themselves&mdash;and that the
festivities were concluded with mutual pleasure to all the parties
who had participated in them. Alas! of the gay party
then assembled&mdash;the gentle maidens in all the bloom of youthful
beauty, the frank young soldiers, the men of fortune, the
delighted parents&mdash;of all these how many now lie low! More,
reader, than you could possibly imagine! Nor can we avoid
exclaiming again, alas that such scenes of rational pleasure,
in which the higher and the humbler classes came together in
healthful and innocent enjoyment, are not now to be seen in
our country as they were heretofore!</p>

<p>But while our memory with changeful feelings of pleasure
and of pain fondly lingers on the brilliant scene we have
attempted to sketch, we must not forget that our subject
requires of us a notice of festivities of a very different character
of which Dalkey was in former times the scene&mdash;when Dublin
and its suburbs poured forth their crowds to enjoy the fun and
drolleries of the crowning of Dalkey’s insular king!&mdash;when
Dalkey, its Common, its Sound, and its Island, on a June
day annually for several years, presented a spectacle of life,
gaiety, good-humour, and enjoyment, such perhaps as was
rarely ever exhibited elsewhere. What a glorious day was
this for the Dunleary, Bullock, and Dalkey boatmen! Generous
fellows! they would take over his majesty’s lieges to
his empire for almost nothing&mdash;frequently for nothing; but,
being determined enemies to absenteeism, they would not allow
them to depart on the same terms, but would mulct those with
taxes <i lang="la">ad libitum</i> who desired to abandon their country. And
again, what a glorious day was this for the jingle-drivers of
the Blackrock, the noddy-drivers, and the drivers of all other
sorts of hired carriages in Dublin! Has it never occurred to
the Railroad people to revive these forgotten frolics? What
a harvest they might reap! But what do we say? The
thing is impossible. The mirthful temperament, the thoughtless
gaiety, the wit and humour that characterised the citizens
in those days, are gone for ever. The Dublinians have become
a grave, thoughtful, and serious people&mdash;we had almost said,
a dull one. Their faces no longer wear a cheerful and happy
look; the very youths of our metropolis seem to be ignorant
of what merriment is, or at best to suppose that it consists in
puffing tobacco smoke!</p>

<p>Ah! very different were the notions of their predecessors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
the nobility and gentry of his Majesty the King of Dalkey!
Smoking would not at all have suited their mercurial temperament:
it would have been the last thing that they would
have thought of to have had their tongues tied and their
mouths contorted into ugliness in the ridiculously serious effort
to hold a cigar between the lips, and look absurdly important!
These fellows thought that mouths were given for
a very different purpose&mdash;to sing the manly song, to throw
forth, not clouds of tobacco smoke, but flashes of wit and humour;
and we are inclined to think they were right.</p>

<p>We are not about to describe the annual ceremony of the
coronation of the Dalkey king, though we should gladly do so
if we had the power, for the memory of it, as an interesting
illustration of the character of Irish society in days not very
remote, should not be allowed to die. We have indeed been
an eye-witness of some of these brilliant follies, but we were
young at the time, and our memory only retains a general
impression of them. We can recollect that the green island
figured in our woodcut, as well as the common, presented
one mass of living beings, gaily dressed and arranged into
groups of happy parties, each with its own musicians. We can
recollect also that the dress of the ladies was almost invariably
white, with green silk bonnets&mdash;a costume that gave a singularly
brilliant effect to the scene. A large marquee was
erected about the centre of the island for the use of his Majesty
and attendant nobles, and a cordon was drawn around
it, within which none others were permitted to enter. There
was a military band in attendance upon the royal party; and
while the noblemen and ladies of the court danced upon the
sod within the bounds, to the music of the state minstrels, the
subjects of the monarch danced outside.</p>

<p>But these were only the evening festivities. The day was
devoted to graver purposes&mdash;the landing of his Majesty and
nobles from the royal barge under a salute of twenty-one
guns, the band playing “God save the King,” and the assembled
multitude rending the air with their acclamations! Then
the ceremony of his coronation, and afterwards his journey
through his dominions, attended by his nobles! At an early
hour the monarch with his court proceeded in ludicrously solemn
procession from the palace to the church&mdash;the roofless
ruin figured in our cut&mdash;in which the ceremony was performed
with a mock gravity which was, however thoughtlessly profane,
still irresistibly humorous. The nobles, with painted
faces and a profuse display of stars and ribbons, had their titles
and appropriate badges of office. There was the grand
chamberlain, with his bunch of old rusty keys&mdash;the archbishop
with his paper mitre and his natural beard of a month’s
growth! The very titles of these great personages were conferred
in a spirit of drollery, and made characteristic of the
peculiarities of the individuals who bore them. Thus there
was a Lord of Ireland’s-eye&mdash;a grave-looking gentleman who
had lost one of his visual organs; a Lord Posey&mdash;a gentleman
who was remarkable for his habit of carrying a bunch of flowers
at his breast; and so on. All the nobility were wits, orators,
and generally first-rate vocalists, and the royal visitors
were similarly gifted. Charles Incledon, the prince of ballad-singers
of his time, here sang his “Black-eyed Susan” and
other charming ditties, and John Philpot Curran, the greatest
wit of the world, set the table in a roar with his meteor flashes.
But the prime spirits of the court were his Majesty himself,
Stephen Armitage, his Lord High Admiral Luke Cassidy,
and his archbishop &mdash;&mdash; Gillespy. The long coronation sermon
of the latter was one of the richest treats of the day,
and produced effects such as sermon never produced before.</p>

<p>During this august and imposing ceremony, the church was
not only crowded to excess, and its ruined walls covered with
human beings, but it was also surrounded with a dense mass
of anxious listeners. As to his Majesty himself, he was at
times the gravest and at times the merriest of monarchs, much
of his humour consisting in the whimsical uncertainty of his
movements, for there never was a crowned head more capricious
or changeable in disposition than the King of Dalkey.
He would set out attended by his court on a journey to some
distant region of his dominions, change his mind in a minute
and alter his route elsewhere, and again change it within a
few minutes; and all these mutations of purpose were most
loyally approved of and sympathised in by his majesty’s nobles
and subjects. Another trait in King Stephen’s character was
his love for song; and when the word ran through his empire
that at the royal banquet his majesty had commenced or was
about to commence his favourite “Love is my passion and
glory,” there was scarcely one of his subjects, male or female,
who did not make a rush to get within earshot of him. Peace
be with thee, Stephen! thou wert a king “of infinite jest, of
most excellent fancy;” and though thy reign was short and
thy dominions small, thou madest more of thy subjects truly
happy than many monarchs whose reigns were as much longer
as their possessions were more extensive!</p>

<p>Imperfect as these recollections of the Dalkey festivities are,
they will perhaps convey to many who have not hitherto heard
of them some slight idea of their character; and they will, we
trust, excite some surviving actor in them to preserve their
memory in a fuller and more graphic record. They were, it
will be seen, a sort of extemporaneous acted drama of the
Tom Thumb kind, admirably preserving the unities of time
and place&mdash;the time being one day, and the place&mdash;his majesty’s
empire! As to the theatre on which it was acted, it was most
admirably adapted for the spectacle, and had the most abundant
accommodation for the audience. The scenery too was
real scenery&mdash;not painted canvass, that required distance to
give it the effect of reality: the greensward, the blue sky and
bluer sea, the rocky islands, the distant hills and mountains,
were painted by the hand of the greatest of all Artists; and
the theatre, instead of miserable foot-lights, had its illumination
from the glorious sun, the greatest of all His visible
works!</p>

<p>It may be supposed that these annual festivities must have
been productive of scenes of drunkenness and quarrelling, and
we cannot state of our own knowledge whether they were so
or not: but we have been informed that they did not lead to
such results; and the statement would seem true, from the
fact that no accident ever occurred to any of those engaged in
them&mdash;a singular circumstance, if we consider the dangers to
which so many persons were exposed in consequence of having
to cross the sound in crowded boats at a late hour in the
evening.</p>

<p class="right">P.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was not till after the preceding article had been in type
that we were informed that a notice of the Dalkey festivities
had recently appeared in the preface to the first volume of
the beautiful edition of the poems of our own national poet,
Moore, just published; and as it adds some interesting facts
to those furnished by our own recollections, we gladly present
them to our readers, in the perfect confidence that they will
be read with that intense pleasure which his writings have
rarely failed to afford.</p>

<p>“It was in the year 1794, or about the beginning of the next,
that I remember having for the first time tried my hand at
political satire. In their very worst times of slavery and
suffering the happy disposition of my countrymen had kept
their cheerfulness still unbroken and buoyant; and at the period
of which I am speaking the hope of a brighter day dawning
upon Ireland had given to the society of the middle class
in Dublin a more than usual flow of hilarity and life. Among
other gay results of this festive spirit, a club or society was
instituted by some of our most convivial citizens, one of whose
objects was to burlesque, good-humouredly, the forms and
pomps of royalty. With this view they established a sort of
mock kingdom, of which Dalkey, a small island near Dublin,
was made the seat; and an eminent pawnbroker named Stephen
Armitage, much renowned for his agreeable singing,
was the chosen and popular monarch.</p>

<p>Before public affairs had become too serious for such pastimes,
it was usual to celebrate yearly at Dalkey the day of
this sovereign’s accession; and among the gay scenes that
still live in my memory, there are few it recalls with more
freshness than this celebration on a fine Sunday in summer of
one of these anniversaries of King Stephen’s coronation. The
picturesque sea views of that spot, the gay crowds along the
shores, the innumerable boats full of life floating about, and
above all, the true spirit of mirth which the Irish temperament
never fails to lend to such meetings, rendered the whole a scene
not easily forgotten. The state ceremonies of the day were
performed with all due gravity within the ruins of an ancient
church that stands on the island, where his mock majesty bestowed
the order of knighthood upon certain favoured personages,
and among others I recollect upon Incledon the
celebrated singer, who rose from under the touch of the royal
sword with the appropriate title of Sir Charles Melody. There
was also selected for the favours of the crown on that day a
lady of no ordinary poetic talent, Mrs Battier, who had gained
much fame by some spirited satires in the manner of Churchill,
and whose kind encouragement of my early attempts in versification
were to me a source of much pride. This lady, as was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
officially announced in the course of the day, had been appointed
his Majesty’s Poetess Laureate, under the style and
title of Henrietta Countess of Laurel.</p>

<p>There could hardly be devised a more apt vehicle for lively
political satire than this gay travestie of monarchical power
and its showy appurtenances so temptingly supplied. The
very day indeed after this commemoration there appeared in
the usual record of Dalkey state intelligence, an amusing
proclamation from the king, offering a large reward in <i lang="ga">cronebanes</i>
(Irish halfpence) to the finder or finders of his Majesty’s
crown, which, owing to his ‘having measured both sides of
the road’ in his pedestrian progress from Dalkey on the preceding
night, had unluckily fallen from the royal brow.”</p>

<h2 class="gap4">IRISH SUPERSTITIONS&mdash;GHOSTS AND FAIRIES.<br />
<span class="smaller">BY WILLIAM CARLETON.</span></h2>

<h3>(First Article.)</h3>

<p>We have met and conversed with every possible representative
of the various classes that compose general society, from
the sweep to the peer, and we feel ourselves bound to say that
in no instance have we ever met any individual, no matter
what his class or rank in life, who was really indifferent to the
subject of dreams, fairies, and apparitions. They are topics
that interest the imagination in all; and the hoary head of age
is inclined with as much interest to a ghost-story, as the
young and eager ear of youth, wrought up by all the nimble
and apprehensive powers of early fancy. It is true the belief
in ghosts is fast disappearing, and that of fairies is already
almost gone; but with what new wonders they shall be replaced,
it is difficult to say. The physical and natural we suppose
will give us enough of the marvellous, without having
recourse to the spiritual and supernatural. Steam and gas,
if Science advance for another half century at the same rate
as she has done in the last, will give sufficient exercise to all
our faculties for wondering. We know a man who travelled
eighty miles to see whether or not it was a fact that light could
be conveyed for miles in a pipe under ground; and this man
to our own knowledge possessed the organ of marvellousness
to a surprising degree. It is singular, too, that his fear of
ghosts was in proportion to this capacious propensity to wonder,
as was his disposition when snug in a chimney corner to
talk incessantly of such topics as were calculated to excite it.</p>

<p>In our opinion, ghosts and fairies will be seen wherever
they are much talked of, and a belief in their existence cultivated
and nourished. So long as the powers of the imagination
are kept warm and active by exercise, they will create
for themselves such images as they are in the habit of conceiving
or dwelling upon; and these, when the individual happens
to be in the appropriate position, will even by the mere
force of association engender the particular Eidolon which is
predominant in the mind. As an illustration of this I shall
mention two cases of apparition which occurred in my native
parish, one of which was that of a ghost, and the other of the
fairies. To those who have read my “Traits and Stories of
the Irish Peasantry,” the first which I shall narrate may possess
some interest, as being that upon which I founded the
tale of the “Midnight Mass.” The circumstances are simply
these:&mdash;</p>

<p>There lived a man named M’Kenna at the hip of one of the
mountainous hills which divide the county of Tyrone from
that of Monaghan. This M’Kenna had two sons, one of whom
was in the habit of tracing hares of a Sunday, whenever there
happened to be a fall of snow. His father it seems had frequently
remonstrated with him upon what he considered to be
a violation of the Lord’s day, as well as for his general neglect
of mass. The young man, however, though otherwise harmless
and inoffensive, was in this matter quite insensible to paternal
reproof, and continued to trace whenever the avocations
of labour would allow him. It so happened that upon a Christmas
morning, I think in the year 1814, there was a deep fall
of snow, and young M’Kenna, instead of going to mass, got
down his cock-stick&mdash;which is a staff much heavier at one end
than at the other&mdash;and prepared to set out on his favourite
amusement. His father seeing this, reproved him seriously, and
insisted that he should attend prayers. His enthusiasm for the
sport, however, was stronger than his love of religion, for he
refused to be guided by his father’s advice. The old man during
the altercation got warm; and on finding that the son obstinately
scorned his authority, he knelt down and prayed that
if the boy persisted in following his own will, he might never
return from the mountains unless as a corpse. The imprecation,
which was certainly as harsh as it was impious and senseless,
might have startled many a mind from a purpose which was,
to say the least of it, at variance with religion and the respect
due to a father. It had no effect, however, upon the son, who is
said to have replied, that whether he ever returned or not, he
was determined on going; and go accordingly he did. He was
not, however, alone, for it appears that three or four of the
neighbouring young men accompanied him. Whether their
sport was good or otherwise, is not to the purpose, neither am
I able to say; but the story goes that towards the latter part
of the day they started a larger and darker hare than any they
had ever seen, and that she kept dodging on before them bit
by bit, leading them to suppose that every succeeding cast of
the cock-stick would bring her down. It was observed afterwards
that she also led them into the recesses of the mountains,
and that although they tried to turn her course homewards,
they could not succeed in doing so. As evening
advanced, the companions of M’Kenna began to feel the folly
of pursuing her farther, and to perceive the danger of losing
their way in the mountains should night or a snow-storm come
upon them. They therefore proposed to give over the chase
and return home; but M’Kenna would not hear of it. “If
you wish to go home, you may,” said he; “as for me, I’ll never
leave the hills till I have her with me.” They begged and entreated
him to desist and return, but all to no purpose: he
appeared to be what the Scotch call <em>fey</em>&mdash;that is, to act as if he
were moved by some impulse that leads to death, and from the
influence of which a man cannot withdraw himself. At length,
on finding him invincibly obstinate, they left him pursuing the
hare directly into the heart of the mountains, and returned to
their respective homes.</p>

<p>In the mean time, one of the most terrible snow-storms ever
remembered in that part of the country came on, and the consequence
was, that the self-willed young man, who had equally
trampled on the sanctions of religion and parental authority,
was given over for lost. As soon as the tempest became still,
the neighbours assembled in a body and proceeded to look for
him. The snow, however, had fallen so heavily that not a single
mark of a footstep could be seen. Nothing but one wide
waste of white undulating hills met the eye wherever it turned,
and of M’Kenna no trace whatever was visible or could be found.
His father now remembering the unnatural character of his
imprecation, was nearly distracted; for although the body had
not yet been found, still by every one who witnessed the sudden
rage of the storm and who knew the mountains, escape or survival
was felt to be impossible. Every day for about a week
large parties were out among the hill-ranges seeking him, but
to no purpose. At length there came a thaw, and his body
was found on a snow-wreath, lying in a supine posture within
a circle which he had drawn around him with his cock-stick.
His prayer-book lay opened upon his mouth, and his hat was
pulled down so as to cover it and his face. It is unnecessary
to say that the rumour of his death, and of the circumstances
under which he left home, created a most extraordinary sensation
in the country&mdash;a sensation that was the greater in
proportion to the uncertainty occasioned by his not having
been found either alive or dead. Some affirmed that he had
crossed the mountains, and was seen in Monaghan; others,
that he had been seen in Clones, in Emyvale, in Fivemiletown;
but despite of all these agreeable reports, the melancholy truth
was at length made clear by the appearance of the body as
just stated.</p>

<p>Now, it so happened that the house nearest the spot where
he lay was inhabited by a man named Daly, I think&mdash;but of
the name I am not certain&mdash;who was a herd or care-taker to
Dr Porter, then Bishop of Clogher. The situation of this
house was the most lonely and desolate-looking that could
be imagined. It was at least two miles distant from any human
habitation, being surrounded by one wide and dreary waste of
dark moor. By this house lay the route of those who had
found the corpse, and I believe the door was borrowed for the
purpose of conveying it home. Be this as it may, the family
witnessed the melancholy procession as it passed slowly
through the mountains, and when the place and circumstances
are all considered, we may admit that to ignorant and superstitious
people, whose minds even under ordinary occasions
were strongly affected by such matters, it was a sight calculated
to leave behind it a deep, if not a terrible impression.
Time soon proved that it did so.</p>

<p>An incident is said to have occurred at the funeral which I
have alluded to in the “Midnight Mass,” and which is certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
in fine keeping with the wild spirit of the whole melancholy
event. When the procession had advanced to a place
called Mullaghtinny, a large dark-coloured hare, which was
instantly recognised, by those who had been out with him on
the hills, as the identical one that led him to his fate, is said to
have crossed the road about twenty yards or so before the
coffin. The story goes, that a man struck it on the side with
a stone, and that the blow, which would have killed any ordinary
hare, not only did it no injury, but occasioned a sound to
proceed from the body resembling the hollow one emitted by
an empty barrel when struck.</p>

<p>In the meantime the interment took place, and the sensation
began like every other to die away in the natural progress
of time, when, behold, a report ran about like wildfire
that, to use the language of the people, “Frank M’Kenna
was <em>appearing</em>!” Seldom indeed was the rumour of an apparition
composed of materials so strongly calculated to win popular
assent or to baffle rational investigation. As every
man is not a Hibbert or a Nicolai, so will many, until such
circumstances are made properly intelligible, continue to yield
credence to testimony which would convince the judgment on
any other subject. The case in question furnished as fine a
specimen of a true ghost-story, freed from any suspicion of
imposture or design, as could be submitted to a philosopher;
and yet, notwithstanding the array of apparent facts connected
with it, nothing in the world is simpler or of easier solution.</p>

<p>One night, about a fortnight after his funeral, the daughter
of Daly, the herd, a girl about fourteen, while lying in bed
saw what appeared to be the likeness of M’Kenna, who had
been lost. She screamed out, and covering her head with the
bed-clothes, told her father and mother that Frank M’Kenna
was in the house. This alarming intelligence naturally produced
great terror; still, Daly, who notwithstanding his belief
in such matters possessed a good deal of moral courage,
was cool enough to rise and examine the house, which consisted
of only one apartment. This gave the daughter some
courage, who, on finding that her father could not see him,
ventured to look out, and she <em>then</em> could see nothing of him
herself. She very soon fell asleep, and her father attributed
what she saw to fear, or some accidental combination of shadows
proceeding from the furniture, for it was a clear moonlight
night. The light of the following day dispelled a great
deal of their apprehensions, and comparatively little was
thought of it until evening again advanced, when the fears of
the daughter began to return. They appeared to be prophetic,
for she said when night came that she knew he would appear
again; and accordingly at the same hour he did so. This was
repeated for several successive nights, until the girl, from the
very hardihood of terror, began to become so far familiarised
to the spectre as to venture to address it.</p>

<p>“In the name of God,” she asked, “what is troubling you,
or why do you appear to me instead of to some of your own
family or relations?”</p>

<p>The ghost’s answer alone might settle the question involved
in the authenticity of its appearance, being, as it was, an account
of one of the most ludicrous missions that ever a spirit
was dispatched upon.</p>

<p>“I’m not allowed,” said he, “to spake to any of my friends,
for I parted wid them in anger; but I’m come to tell you that
they are quarrellin’ about my breeches&mdash;a new pair that I got
made for Christmas day; an’ as I was comin’ up to thrace in
the mountains, I thought the ould ones ’ud do betther, an’ of
coorse I didn’t put the new pair an me. My raison for appearin’,”
he added, “is, that you may tell my friends that none
of them is to wear them&mdash;they must be given in charity.”</p>

<p>This serious and solemn intimation from the ghost was duly
communicated to the family, and it was found that the circumstances
were exactly as it had represented them. This of
course was considered as sufficient proof of the truth of its
mission. Their conversations now became not only frequent,
but quite friendly and familiar. The girl became a favourite
with the spectre, and the spectre on the other hand soon lost
all his terrors in her eyes. He told her that whilst his friends
were bearing home his body, the handspikes or poles on which
they carried him had cut his back, and <em>occasioned him great
pain</em>! The cutting of the back also was found to be true,
and strengthened of course the truth and authenticity of
their dialogues. The whole neighbourhood was now in a
commotion with this story of the apparition, and persons incited
by curiosity began to visit the girl in order to satisfy
themselves of the truth of what they had heard. Every
thing, however, was corroborated, and the child herself, without
any symptoms of anxiety or terror, artlessly related her
conversations with the spirit. Hitherto their interviews had
been all nocturnal, but now that the ghost found his footing
made good, he put a hardy face on, and ventured to appear
by daylight. The girl also fell into states of syncope, and
while the fits lasted, long conversations with him upon the
subject of God, the blessed Virgin, and Heaven, took place
between them. He was certainly an excellent moralist, and
gave the best advice. Swearing, drunkenness, theft, and
every evil propensity of our nature, were declaimed against
with a degree of spectral eloquence quite surprising. Common
fame had now a topic dear to her heart, and, never was a
ghost made more of by his best friends, than she made of him.
The whole country was in a tumult, and I well remember the
crowds which flocked to the lonely little cabin in the mountains,
now the scene of matters so interesting and important.
Not a single day passed in which I should think from ten to
twenty, thirty, or fifty persons, were not present at these
singular interviews. Nothing else was talked of, thought of,
and, as I can well testify, dreamt of. I would myself have gone
to Daly’s were it not for a confounded misgiving I had, that
perhaps the ghost might take such a fancy of appearing to
me, as he had taken to cultivate an intimacy with the girl;
and it so happens, that when I see the face of an individual
nailed down in the coffin&mdash;chilling and gloomy operation!&mdash;I
experience no particular wish ever to look upon it again.</p>

<p>Many persons might imagine that the herd’s daughter was
acting the part of an impostor, by first originating and then
sustaining such a delusion. If any one, however, was an
impostor, it was the ghost, and not the girl, as her ill health
and wasted cheek might well testify. The appearance of
M’Kenna continued to haunt her for months. The reader is
aware that he was lost on Christmas day, or rather on the
night of it, and I remember seeing her in the early part of the
following summer, during which time she was still the victim
of a diseased imagination. Every thing in fact that could be
done for her was done. They brought her to a priest named
Donnelly, who lived down at Ballynasaggart, for the purpose
of getting her cured, as he had the reputation of performing
cures of that kind. They brought her also to the doctors,
who also did what they could for her; but all to no purpose.
Her fits were longer and of more frequent occurrence; her
appetite left her; and ere four months had elapsed, she herself
looked as like a spectre as the ghost himself could do for the
life of him.</p>

<p>Now, this was a pure case of spectral illusion, and precisely
similar to that detailed so philosophically by Nicolai the
German bookseller, and to others mentioned by Hibbert. The
image of M’Kenna not only appeared to her in daylight at
her own house, but subsequently followed her wherever she
went; and what proved this to have been the result of diseased
organization, produced at first by a heated and excited
imagination, was, that, as the story went, she could see him
with her eyes shut. Whilst this state of mental and physical
feeling lasted, she was the subject of the most intense curiosity.
No matter where she went, whether to chapel, to fair, or to
market, she was followed by crowds, every one feeling eager
to get a glimpse of the girl who had actually seen, and what
was more, spoken to a ghost&mdash;a live ghost.</p>

<p>Now, here was a young girl of an excitable temperament
and large imagination, leading an almost solitary life amidst
scenery of a lonely and desolate character, who, happening to
be strongly impressed with an image of horror&mdash;for surely
such was the body of a dead man seen in association with
such peculiarly frightful circumstances as filial disobedience
and a father’s curse were calculated to give it&mdash;cannot shake
it off, but on the contrary becomes a victim to the disease
which it generates. There is not an image which we see in a
fever, or a face whether of angel or devil, or an uncouth
shape of any kind, that is not occasioned by cerebral excitement,
or derangement of the nervous system, analogous to
that under which Daly’s daughter laboured. I saw her several
times, and remember clearly that her pale face, dark
eye, and very intellectual forehead, gave indications of such
a temperament as under her circumstances would be apt to
receive strong and fearful impressions from images calculated
to excite terror, especially of the supernatural. It only now
remains for me to mention the simple method of her cure,
which was effected without either priest or doctor. It depended
upon a word or two of advice given to her father by
a very sensible man, who was in the habit of thinking on these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
matters somewhat above the superstitious absurdities of the
people.</p>

<p>“If you wish your daughter to be cured,” said he to her
father, “leave the house you are now living in. Take her to
some part of the country where she can have companions of
her own class and state of life to mingle with; bring her
away from the place altogether; for you may rest assured that
so long as there are objects before her eyes to remind her of
what happened, she will not mend on your hands.”</p>

<p>The father, although he sat rent free, took this excellent
advice, even at a sacrifice of some comfort: for nothing short
of the temptation of easy circumstances could have induced
any man to reside in so wild and remote a solitude. In the
course of a few days he removed from it with his family, and
came to reside amidst the cheerful aspect and enlivening intercourse
of human life. The consequences were precisely as
the man had told him. In the course of a few weeks the little
girl began to find that the visits of the spectre were like those
of angels, few and far between. She was sent to school, and
what with the confidence derived from human society, and
the substitution of new objects and images, she soon perfectly
recovered, and ere long was thoroughly set free from the fearful
creation of her own brain.</p>

<p>Now, there is scarcely one of the people in my native parish
who does not believe that the spirit of this man came back
to the world, and actually appeared to this little girl. The
time, however, is fast coming when these empty bugbears will
altogether disappear, and we shall entertain more reverend
and becoming notions of God than to suppose such senseless
pranks could be played by the soul of a departed being under
his permission. We might as well assert that the imaginary
beings which surround the couch of the madman or hypochondriac
have a real existence, as those that are conjured up by
terror, weak nerves, or impure blood.</p>

<p>The spot where the body of M’Kenna was found is now
marked by a little heap of stones, which has been collected
since the melancholy event of his death. Every person who
passes it throws a stone upon the heap; but why this old custom
is practised, or what it means, I do not know, unless it
be simply to mark the spot as a visible means of preserving
the memory of the occurrence.</p>

<p>Daly’s house, the scene of the supposed apparition, is now
a shapeless ruin, which could scarcely be seen were it not for
the green spot that was once a garden, and which now shines
at a distance like an emerald, but with no agreeable or pleasing
associations. It is a spot which no solitary schoolboy will
ever visit, nor indeed would the unflinching believer in the popular
nonsense of ghosts wish to pass it without a companion.
It is under any circumstances a gloomy and barren place, but
when looked upon in connection with what we have just recited,
it is lonely, desolate, and awful.</p>

<h2 class="gap4"><span class="irish">Un Ghrain̄eog.</span>&mdash;(THE HEDGEHOG.)</h2>

<p>Some twenty years ago it was not unusual in the south of
Ireland to see boys assembled about a fire of straw, loudly
exulting over a flame-surrounded victim, whose attempts to
escape, rendered nugatory by a timid retraction as it were
into himself, served but to call forth louder shouts of triumph
from his persecutors, who thought they justified their savage
deed by proclaiming its hapless object as a witch, a robber of
orchards, and a sucker of cows. Leaving to our antiquarian
friends to discover whether the cruel act in question was not
a holocaust originating in the mystic rites of Pagan times, it
is for us to vindicate the wronged, and show the absurdity of
the charges by which wrong has been maintained, and at the
same time to indicate such matter as may serve to direct kindness
to that innocent victim of ignorance, the inoffensive Hedgehog.
That it is not a witch according to the old law, may be
proved in a court of justice spite of the popular opinion and
in defiance of the authority of Shakspeare, whose witches in
Macbeth are warned that the proper time had come to commence
their infernal incantations by “thrice and once the
hedge-pig whined.” We have no witness that a hedgehog
ever rode a broomstick or vomited knives, skewers, coals of
fire, or any such like legal proofs of witchcraft; neither, perhaps
you exclaim, is the writer of so much nonsense a witch.
True it is that the creature so named has its place nowhere
in the classification of a zoologist, yet still an undefined idea
of its existence floats in the imagination of the most ignorant,
and it is not <em>extraordinary</em> that an opinion once universal
should still linger in unenlightened minds. In no way do we
consider superstitious prejudices can better be extinguished
than by inducing accuracy of observation of natural phenomena,
which shows that nothing supernatural exists. The
second charge, that the hedgehog is a robber of orchards, is
a very old one. Pliny, as translated by Holland, states&mdash;“Hedgehogs
make their provision beforehand of meat for
winter in this wise: they wallow and roll themselves upon
apples and such fruit lying under foot, and so catch them up
with their prickles, and one more besides they take in their
mouth, and so carry them into hollow trees.”</p>

<p>Now, this has no foundation in fact. True it is that the
hedgehog is very often found in the neighbourhood of orchards;
but then this may be accounted for by the fact that
the fences of such places are usually of exactly the thick and
unfrequented kind the animal best likes to inhabit. Our repeated
experience has never enabled us to discover that a
hedgehog will eat apples; on the contrary, in early youth,
when imbued with the general belief that this fruit was their
diet, we have in more than one or two instances (most cruelly
as we now believe) starved to death unfortunate specimens,
which we shut up in a box with an ample supply of apples, not
one of which they ever ate. That a magpie will steal and
hide silver spoons, or a raven silk stockings, we know, and
may use it as an argument that animals steal what they do
not want; but that a hedgehog steals apples in the way
stated, experiment will at once prove to be untrue, for, from
the varied position of the points of the spines when fixed, it
is impossible to fasten an apple upon them; and when they are
not fixed, they yield at once to the pressure made in the attempt.
Though domesticated hedgehogs can easily be brought
to feed on bread and milk or dressed vegetables, yet all our
observation goes to prove that in a state of nature, or when
permitted to stray in a garden, they never eat any but animal
food. This is at variance with the generally received opinion,
which is supported by the authority of White, who, in
his admirable History of Selborne, complains that hedgehogs
injured his garden by boring with their long snouts under the
plantain that grew in his grass walks, eating off the root upwards,
leaving the tufts of leaves untouched, and defacing his
grounds by making unsightly holes. He then immediately
goes on to prove that these identical animals used beetles as
no inconsiderable portion of their food. Now, it strikes us
that his previous observation was not made with his usual accuracy,
and that the hedgehogs did not eat the roots of plantain,
but dug up where they had been to catch the larvæ of
beetles that had just devoured them. Thus rooks have been
charged with wantonly plucking up grass, while the truth is,
that they only pull up plants attacked at the root by the larvæ
of the cockchaffer or some other of the <i>Phytophagous coleoptera</i>
(as vegetable-eating beetles are called), catch in the fact
the destructive insect, and so stop its ravages; thus rendering
important services to those who, for lack of accurate observation,
falsely accuse and mischievously shoot them. Trusting
we have satisfied you that the hedgehog does not steal apples,
we come to the next charge, that he sucks cows. To
refute this we have the best possible evidence in the animal’s
mouth, the structure of which is completely unsuited to the
accomplishment of such an object. That he will drink milk
with avidity when domesticated, is certain, but this is only a
taste he acquires in common with hundreds of other animals:
there is scarcely one that may not be induced to relish such
diet. Having thus cleared our hero (a name he fully deserves,
as he wins battles by passive resistance) from the charges
brought against him, we proceed to give some anecdotes of
our personal knowledge, and shall finish with a few interesting
facts in his history, for the information of those who take pleasure
in accurate acquaintance with nature’s works.</p>

<p>We have before mentioned our starving of hedgehogs by
endeavouring to make them eat apples. In one of these cases
we suffered no small retribution. We were at school in these
days, and a practice existed amongst us called “slating.”
It was an innocent imitation of the murderous attacks made
in Dublin by short-sighted combinators on such of their fellow
tradesmen as refused obedience to their mischievous laws.
With us it consisted in waylaying each other in the dark passages,
and striking with the open palms the hats or caps of the
surprised over the eyes. Having been thus treated many
times, we bethought ourselves of turning our starved hedgehog
to account, and proceeded to skin him with the intent of
making a cap; so that when again “slated,” the attacking
party would find reason to call out in the words of Chaucer,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Like sharpe urchins his hair was growe.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>Accordingly, having hanged the animal up against a tree, we
were essaying, by pulling, to effect a solution of continuity, as
a surgeon would call it, between his body and skin, when the
nail gave way, and he came down with considerable force on
our forehead, accupuncturating us most awfully. The pain
at the time was very great, and considerable soreness continued
for several days, so much so that we were induced to
suspect that some poisonous virus existed. We introduce this
story for the purpose of calling attention to the effects of the
spines when brought into action. Though experience induces
us to believe that their punctures are more painful than those
of pins and needles, we have not been able to ascertain why
they should be so. Disabled in our attempt, we abandoned
the skin, and it became common property. It was for some
time used as one of the instruments for initiating the Johnny
Newcomes into the mysteries of school life. Not a few will
recollect how, when chilled by a previous salting or seasoning,
as we called it, of snow crammed into the mouth, eyes, nose,
and down the back, their sense of vitality was aroused, when
escaping to bed they threw themselves on its thorny pre-occupant.
Many, doubtless, then heartily wished themselves again
within the zone of mamma’s apron-string; but the affair usually
ended by storing up vengeance for, and the implement for
executing it on, the next comer. A few years afterwards we
procured another hedgehog, and provided him with earthworms,
which he munged with great gusto. We mixed a few
of them with bread and milk, and thus initiated him into this
new diet. We tried him with frogs, mice, sparrows, and various
other animal matters, of all of which he partook freely,
and he soon became quite domesticated. We provided him a
bed made in an old footstool in the kitchen; in this he remained
during daylight rolled up in a ball of hay, from which it was
quite a troublesome matter to extricate him; he could not be
disentangled from it at all, without picking it carefully from his
spines. Yet when he pleased himself to move, he came forth
quite free, and did not drag a single filament out with him.
He soon acquired a habit of making his appearance when tea
was being served; the hissing of the water in the urn seemed
to be his signal that his only meal was ready, for he regularly
followed the servant who bore it into the tea-room, where he
was indulged with a saucer of bread and milk on the rug before
the fire. Having eaten as much as he desired, he commenced
trotting about the room, taking precisely the same
course round the legs of chairs and tables each time; and so
he continued without a moment’s cessation to the latest hour
the household remained up. Like the Guinea-pig, he seemed
to have the greatest dislike to running across the room. In
the morning he was always found snug in his bed. At length
he disappeared, but previously did good service by devouring
the cockroaches and beetles which infested the house. The
desire of the hedgehog to pursue a beaten track was further
evidenced by one we kept in a garden, which continued for
months the course he first took, though a portion of it consisted
in climbing with difficulty over some tiles, which a few
inches on either side would have avoided. We often put things
in his path, and watched his proceedings: he shrunk at first
on finding the obstruction, and then tumbled over it in the
best way he could.</p>

<p>Again we got another, and having heard that he may be at
once tamed by indulging him in whisky, we mixed some
in a saucer with sugar, and dipping his nose into it, he licked
his chops, then ventured to make a lap at the enticing material,
and, “startled at the sound himself had made,” he shrunk
in, but came out again presently and lapped away most eagerly.
The spirit soon showed its power, and like other beasts that
indulge in it, he was any thing but himself; and his lacklustre
leaden eye was rendered still less pleasing by its inane
drunken expression. He staggered towards us in a ridiculously
get-out-of-my-way sort of manner; however, he had
not gone far before his potation produced all its effects;
he tottered, then fell on his side; he was drunk in the
full sense of the word; he could not even hold by the
ground. We could then pull him about by the feet, open his
mouth, twitch his whiskers, &amp;c.: he was unresisting. There
was a strange expression in his face of that self-confidence
which we see in cowards when inspired by drinking. We
put him away, and some twelve hours afterwards found
him running about, and, as was predicted, quite tame, his
spines lying so smoothly and regularly that he could be stroked
down the back, and handled freely. We turned him into the
kitchen to kill the cockroaches, and know nothing further of
him.</p>

<p>Having given you so much of his manners, let us turn to his
structural peculiarities. He is a small animal, not much larger
than a rat when stripped of his spines and the muscular apparatus
connected with them. It is this that enables him to roll
himself up so as to present a <i lang="fr">chevaux-de-frize</i>-like defence,
impregnable to all ordinary enemies; and as there is much
singularity in it, we will endeavour to describe it. On the
back of the animal, between the skin and ribs, there is a large
oval muscle with thickened edges, partially attached to the
skin and spines. From this spring certain muscular bands,
which are fixed firmly at the other ends to the head, tail,
breast, and other parts of the body. The whole may be
likened to a sort of elastic mantle, kept on the back by straps.
When the owner wishes to roll up, he bends his body, then
tightening the straps, he pulls the edge of the elastic mantle
over, which contracting, draws it in as if it were a running
string in a bag; at the same time the spines are fixed rigidly
for defence by the straining of the muscles. There are many
other interesting points in his anatomy. He possesses, as we
do, well developed clavicles or collar-bones, which only exist
in a rudimentary form in many quadrupeds. The peculiarities
of his structure have exposed him to much, we will not say
wanton cruelty, as its object was the increase of knowledge;
it therefore should not be heavily censured, while so many unmeaning
barbarities exist under the name of sports. It is
stated as a proof of his endurance, that he has died without a
groan under the slow process of zootomy inflicted upon him
while nailed to a table. Such practices are seldom if ever
engaged in at the present time.</p>

<p>The hedgehog is certainly a very apathetic creature, and at
a low temperature becomes torpid; when in this condition he is
doubtless devoid of feeling. Torpidity in many animals seems
to stand in the place of migration in others, as a necessary
condition when provision of food depends on season: in this case
the fact seems to argue in favour of our position&mdash;that the
hedgehog is in a state of nature strictly insectivorous; were
it not so, torpidity would not seem necessary, as roots of vegetables
could be had with facility as well at one season as
the other. The hedgehog while torpid loses weight rather
rapidly, so that the power of its remaining in this state is
limited perhaps to a very few months.</p>

<p>The French academicians maintained long since that there
were two species of hedgehog in their country. In reference
to this, Ray, with his usual sagacity, after describing the
common species, expresses a disbelief of there being another
in Europe; a doubt since fully confirmed: for the dog and
hog urchin, as the supposed species were called, have no more
existence than the dog and hog badgers of our sportsmen have
as distinct animals. Old authors notice several species under
the name of hedgehog; but it appears by more accurate observation
that but two of the animals mentioned by them are
entitled to this name, viz. the one in question and the long-eared
urchin of Siberia.</p>

<p>Since 1832, at least three other species have been enrolled
in the records of science. It is said that when hedgehogs are
born, their ears as well as their eyes are closed, and the
former circumstance is noticed as a unique fact; however,
another instance of imperforate ears occurred to us, in the case
of a black bear cubbed at the gardens of the Royal Zoological
Society of Ireland: it lived but a few hours. The ear of
the hedgehog, in the structure of its bony parts, presents some
peculiarities strikingly different from most other quadrupeds.</p>

<p>The hedgehog is said to feed occasionally on cantharides; a
single beetle of which would occasion death or serious injury
to most animals. If this be true, it is only another example of
what often occurs in nature, illustrating the old proverb
“what is one’s meat is another’s poison.” In addition to the
use of the hedgehog as the destroyer of cockroaches, his skin
was an important monopoly in the time of the Romans, being
used both as a clothes-brush and an instrument for hackling
hemp. His calcined eyes formed part of an ointment which
the ancients tell us had such a wonderful efficacy as to enable
persons using it to see in the dark. His gall was used to take
off hair, his fat to put it on, &amp;c.</p>

<p>He is still eaten in the south of Europe; but, judging from
his food and appearance, we would not recommend the practice
here. The hedgehog, or urchin, as he is sometimes called,
belongs to the order of Insectivora, and possesses much of the
character and habits of shrews. His scientific name is Erinaceus
Europæus; but we have headed this article with his Irish
appellation, which is perhaps the only one not inserted in our
popular authors.</p>

<h2 class="gap4">WATERPROOFING OF CLOTH, SILK, &amp;c.</h2>

<p class="center">TO THE EDITOR OF THE IRISH PENNY JOURNAL.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>&mdash;I would feel happy should the few remarks I will at
present offer be found worthy of insertion in your columns&mdash;it
is on the subject of waterproofing cloth, or other fabrics,
cotton, silk, leather, &amp;c.</p>

<p>When the matter first came before the public, being determined
if possible to ascertain the secret, after many unsuccessful
experiments I found all the requisite properties to consist
in a concentrated solution of acetate of alumina, which can be
procured at a cheap and a moderate rate, by mixing equal
quantities of sulphate of alum (common alum) and acetate of
lead (sugar of lead), and dissolving them in water: one
pound of each may be purchased for one shilling, which may
be dissolved in one gallon and a half of boiling water, and well
mixed; when cold, the supernatant liquid should be removed
from the sediment, which consists of sulphates of lead, potash,
&amp;c. Any article of dress, no matter how slight the fabric, if
well saturated in it, and allowed to dry slowly, will bear the
action of boiling water, and not permit it to pass through: it
is a remarkable fact, and there are many others connected
with the same solution well worthy of investigation. I
should be glad if some of your learned correspondents would
favour us with the reason why the boiling water will not pass
through, and the steam of the water will. Thinking it a subject
not totally unworthy of examination, I remain, Sir, your
most obedient servant,</p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">True Charity.</span>&mdash;The lowest order of charity is that which
is satisfied with relieving the immediate pressure of distress
in individual cases. A higher is, that which makes provision
on a large scale for the relief of such distress; as when a nation
passes on from common almsgiving to a general provision
for the destitute. A higher still is, when such provision
is made in the way of anticipation, or for distant objects; as
when the civilization of savages, the freeing of slaves, the
treatment of the insane, or the education of the blind and deaf
and mutes, is undertaken. The highest charity of all is, that
which aims at the prevention rather than the alleviation of
evil. It is a nobler charity to prevent destitution, crime, and
ignorance, than to relieve individuals who never ought to have
been made destitute, criminal, and ignorant.</p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">Employment for the Unhappy.</span>&mdash;The unhappy are indisposed
to employment: all active occupations are wearisome
and disgusting in prospect, at a time when every thing,
life itself, is full of weariness and disgust. Yet the unhappy
must be employed, or they will go mad. Comparatively
blessed are they, if they are set in families, where claims and
duties abound, and cannot be escaped. In the pressure of
business there is present safety and ultimate relief. Harder
is the lot of those who have few necessary occupations, enforced
by other claims than their own harmlessness and profitableness.
Reading often fails. Now and then it may beguile;
but much oftener the attention is languid, the thoughts
wander, and associations with the subject of grief are awakened.
Women who find that reading will not do, will obtain
no relief from sewing. Sewing is pleasant enough in moderation
to those whose minds are at ease the while; but it is an
employment which is trying to the nerves when long continued,
at the best; and nothing can be worse for the harassed, and
for those who want to escape from themselves. Writing is
bad. The pen hangs idly suspended over the paper, or the
sad thoughts that are alive within write themselves down.
The safest and best of all occupations for such sufferers as are
fit for it, is intercourse with young children. An infant might
have beguiled Satan and his peers the day after they were
couched on the lake of fire, if the love of children had chanced
to linger amidst the ruins of their angelic nature. Next to
this comes honest, genuine acquaintanceship among the poor;
not mere charity-visiting, grounded on soup-tickets and
blankets, but intercourse of mind, with real mutual interest
between the parties. Gardening is excellent, because it unites
bodily exertion with a sufficient engagement of the faculties,
while sweet, compassionate nature is ministering cure in every
sprouting leaf and scented blossom, and beckoning sleep to
draw nigh, and be ready to follow up her benignant work.
Walking is good, not stepping from shop to shop, or from
neighbour to neighbour, but stretching out far into the country,
to the freshest fields, and the highest ridges, and the
quietest lanes. However sullen the imagination may have been
among its griefs at home, here it cheers up and smiles. However
listless the limbs may have been when sustaining a too
heavy heart, here they are braced, and the lagging gait becomes
buoyant again. However perverse the memory may
have been in presenting all that was agonizing, and insisting
only on what cannot be retrieved, here it is first disregarded,
and then it sleeps; and the sleep of the memory is the day
in Paradise to the unhappy. The mere breathing of the cool
wind on the face in the commonest highway is rest and comfort
which must be felt at such times to be believed. It is
disbelieved in the shortest intervals between the seasons of enjoyment;
and every time the sufferer has resolution to go
forth to meet it, it penetrates to the very heart in glad surprise.
The fields are better still: for there is the lark to
fill up the hours with mirthful music; or, at worst, the robin
and the flocks of fieldfares, to show that the hardest day has
its life and hilarity. But the calmest region is the upland,
where human life is spread out beneath the bodily eye, where
the mind roves from the peasant’s nest to the spiry town,
from the schoolhouse to the churchyard, from the diminished
team in the patch of fallow, or the fisherman’s boat in the
cove, to the viaduct that spans the valley, or the fleet that
glides ghostlike on the horizon. This is the perch where the
spirit plumes its ruffled and drooping wings, and makes ready
to let itself down any wind that heaven may send.&mdash;<cite>From
Deerbrook, a Tale, by Harriet Martineau.</cite></p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">Childhood.</span>&mdash;Childhood is like a mirror, catching and reflecting
images from all around it. Remember that an impious
or profane thought, uttered by a parent’s lips, may
operate on the young heart like a careless spray of water
thrown upon polished steel, staining it with rust which no
after scouring can efface.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
